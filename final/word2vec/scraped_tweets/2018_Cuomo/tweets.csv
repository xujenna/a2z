It's not a NIMBY argument. There are other ways to fix the transit system than congestion pricing. The powers to be need to stop putting the burden on the everyday average person. Again like I said there are other alternative ways than CP.
What about people who cannot use public transportation say for health reasons? Should they have to pay extra just to get around? Why should the everyday person pay more?  People who use Access a ride will he paying more soon.  Again how is CP going to help alleviate that burden ?
One our whole geography is different. Like snowflakes no two are the same. Why are the powers to be so dang afraid of a millionaires tax? That would be better instituted than congestion pricing.That 15 dollar toll is tax deduction for companies.

Amen. There was the IDC issue: Democrats in the prior State Senate who voted with GOP stopped this among other things. I think Assembly is OK & there is a new NY Senate. Gov. Cuomo? Dare I say a mixed bag? He is 2nd gen governor. More political than Dad? NY Turmoil. Pressure.

I think the only place worse than NY is NJ as far as politics go..How the hell could anybody put Bob Menendez back in the Senate?  He makes Andrew Cuomo look like a boy scout.
Cuomo crushed Astorino in NYC thanks to outspending him 10-1 and huge Dem reg advantage. But he lost to Astorino outside NYC. Cuomo has some political skills and instincts but I believe he mostly benefits from huge advantages in money and Dem voter registration.
@NYGovCuomo What will companies like Amazon think about expanding in NYS when the Gov is publicly picketing with unions?  Perhaps better for the Gov to be an honest broker to bring parties together?

Q: Why not? A: Cuomo
Actually Cuomo is in change of funding the MTA
Andrew Cuomo hates New York City.
"Hi there, thank you for reaching out to us. Please let us know if you need any further assistance. Thank you."
"The Mayor & City Council, whether you like them or not, do run our drinking water and sewer pipes, and that infrastructure seems to work better than the MTA. Would you want the Governor and legislature in Albany to control your water and sewer? Can you say ‚ÄúService Disruption?‚Äù"
Are you saying that Cuomo is the one that did that? Did I read correctly ! The man is driving me nuts.
"The legislature - which has also been derelict with no oversight of MTA. A state senator from Tonawanda will never be held accountable for NYC transit, because her constituents don‚Äôt ride it or pay the fares or taxes. Why should she vote get to vote on MTA board members?"
"Any day now though, Bro. Would be nice."
"It‚Äôs not about THIS Mayor or THAT Governor, tho current occupants of both those offices are bad for transit. It IS about unaccountable state control (but not real state money) of a basic local service. For much of its 50 years, not just now, state rule has been detrimental."
"No exclamation points. No caps lock. Literally nothing to imply outrage. Just a guy responding to someone who tweeted at him. But if you‚Äôre that pressed to burn Cuomo with contrived condescension, maybe wait for a moment that actually makes sense. It‚Äôs not a race, champ. üëçüèª"
"With Board members like this Cuomo hack, the MTA doesn't need enemies or natural disasters to blow it up and shut it down. Good grief.  https://twitter.com/A_W_Gordon/status/1069641943393714176¬†‚Ä¶"
