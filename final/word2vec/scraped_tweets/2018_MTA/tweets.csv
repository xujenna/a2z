You know that the board wants to cut down cleaning at the beginning and end of the line?  I can only imagine what trains will look like when that happens.  Also the MTA does a deep clean of the trains every 8-10 weeks.  Just sharing.

3 hours and $16.50 later I‚Äôm still NOT at work! Thanks @MTA
Some days I love this city and other days I'm 30 minutes late to work due to no fault of my own (@MTA) & I get why people leave.
Nope parts of Coney island are transit deserts. Let's face it each borough/neighborhood has serious transit issues. All which need to be addressed. But first the MTA must blame commuters for taking transit and gumming up the works.
"yesterday, i met a young woman on the Q train, who lives in canarsie & works in the Bronx, she said it takes 1.5/2hours to get to work... she thinks she should drive be/c it would be faster #wtf #mtafail #cuomofail - city MTA ‚Äúofficials‚Äù get your subway shit together ü§®"

Why can't the @MTA ever give us an estimate for how long we'll be delayed? 5 minutes and I'll stay put. 20 and I could've taken a car and been home. How long does it take to fix brakes or whatever?  pic.twitter.com/5hLet60L7B
"I hate the MTA for so many reasons constant stupid delays, change of service, etc... but the conductor keeping all the doors open while we are delayed on an above ground train, while he comfortably sits in his closed off area, that really grinded my gears today. @MTA"

Northbound F trains are currently holding in stations because someone thought it would be funny.
"So @MTA you have two trains on different tracks sitting (we're at almost 10 min now) but not in the station where we could actually board, rest, and maybe hear an announcement because the system is so old dispatchers can't tell where the trains are.

There's another methodological issue.  I think they failed to look for (or control for) an interaction of paid fares x evasion rate on a per-station basis.  There are several reasons why the least-used stations would actually have the highest evasion rates.  See what happens? 1/2

That's because all the people who would be impacted are still struggling to get home. Let's not make believe you can be anywhere on Staten Island before 6:30-7pm unless you work on Staten Island.
Every year @MTA getting worse and worse....while the prices keep going higher and higher....
@MTA can I have the $32 y‚Äôall stole from me back?
This would be a great time for the @MTA to announce this Wednesday's coming subway delays and outages.  https://twitter.com/KMOV/status/1069708624895844353¬†‚Ä¶

"@MTA 7 train is the worst, we are waiting in Woodside too much time!"
They should have scheduled it later or for a weekend. It takes Staten Islanders around two hours to get home from work.
7 trains are running with delays in both directions because you need to be late to work once in a while

There is a serious methodological issue here: the observers should also be required to estimate _paid_ ridership.  No way to even guess at their error rate elsewise.
Quick take on MTA farebeating presentation: the problem is more severe than I thought. But there are inherent limitations to this analysis. The MTA counted people who don't swipe. Some may have unlimiteds and are just doing the faster thing b/c they don't think it matters.
"Fear not. As I‚Äôm sitting on my REROUTED TRAIN, I had a vision - I‚Äôm going to win the lottery and buy up some buildings that these asshole people are letting sit empty for tax write-offs and fill them with artists just like the Village once was...hence the name, ‚ÄúVillage.‚Äù"

Everything sucks about the @MTA except G train conductors‚ù£Ô∏è
"The L Train is fine it seems, but @MTA is about to shut it down for a couple of years so enjoy it while it lasts #CuomosMTA"
It‚Äôs time to tear down the MTA and strongly reconsider local control.

Thanks .@MTA for that exciting start to the week! Scrambled to drive my kid across the park so he could get a train in to the city and even then he was still late. Tons of kids at my daughter's Brooklyn school getting late passes because their trains were so bad.

The MTA plans to stop cleaning many subway trains at both terminal ends of the trip to save costs.
This allows the MTA to reduce train frequency because trains you and I view as ‚Äútoo crowded‚Äù won‚Äôt be considered that way by the MTA. So more crowded less frequent trains coming in 2020.   What a total joke to pin declining ridership on farebeating even a little.  https://twitter.com/A_W_Gordon/status/1069618262537850880¬†‚Ä¶
the mta probably spent millions on those shitty new bus trackers that already don‚Äôt work at all and serve no purpose lmao (not funny at all)
"An elevator just went out of service at the Utica Av station, which serves the #A #C lines. It is the one that is on the street to mezzanine."
71 Av-bound M trains are running on the F line from 47-50 Sts-Rockefeller Ctr to 36 St (Queens) because there were too many @casper ads
"MTA Transit President Andy Byford says the agency has been able to save some money they pay to the NYPD. Because there are less fare evasion arrests, that means less overtime pay for NYPD officers."
the only department more harmful than the MTA is the NYPD for poor people and no i won‚Äôt be hearing counter arguments
NYCT Prez Byford says MTA will save money now by not paying NYPD $4M for overtime for fare evasion patrols.
@MTA i like just Boarded a new Updated Subway Train !! # C Line
Unacceptable but its not an argument for keeping the status quo unaccountability at the MTA which effects 6 million subway riders and 2 million bus riders every day.   Give me the exact address and my office will call PD on this location.   cc: @seancoughlinnyc

@MTA you are the absolute worst. Just opened doors on the wrong side at Astoria Blvd and left without the 200+ ppl waiting. Booth has no idea what's going on and what side ppl should go to for next train.
"It‚Äôs bigger than one Mayor or a single elected official. Mayors come & go but the MTA sadly is a constant lesson in diffuse accountability.  It‚Äôs hard to get the busses moving without congestion pricing, variable road pricing & giving straphangers confidence in the subway."

Sure. I can send you pictures often. This happens once or twice a week at least.
(@NYCTSubway is the catchy handle of the actual MTA subway alert system.)
The attendant working the NW Astoria Blvd stop is sending everyone to the southbound platform although no trains are stopping there at this time. (Southbound trains are stopping at the northbound express track.) Saw tons of people stranded. Spreading misinformation now? @MTA
@MTA manhattan bound trains just stranded hundreds of riders at Astoria Blvd because no one communicated which set of doors would open #unacceptable
Or it could be east side access. Or 2nd phase on 2nd ave line. Wasteful spending on prettying up stations. C-suiters making 6 figures. Things that make you go hmmmmmmü§î
@MTA the lack of communication is outrageous! Tell people where to get the trains they need and pay for.
Sounds good.
Dammit! I got taken by a parody MTA account. I've made it years without falling for a fake twitter account. Today is officially the worst day of my life.
It‚Äôs crystal clear to the public that the mayor is in charge of NYCHA; the City Council holds regular NYCHA oversight hearings. It‚Äôs unclear to the public who‚Äôs in charge of the MTA (it‚Äôs the governor); when‚Äôs the last time the state legislature held an MTA oversight hearing?

"MTA board member Larry Schwartz, who is heading this meeting, apologized for starting 15 minutes late. His train was late, he says: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the truth.‚Äù"

Why is every person I follow tweeting a fake MTA account?
"My train is creeping slowly through Manhattan, an almost daily affair. The MTA website says good service, though my commute is 10-15 minutes longer than it should be. Not a catastrophic delay like some of you faced this morning, but when will it get better?!"

"LADIES: please participate in this anonymous poll!!! i wanna see our stats, sisters. how do you position your body when you masturbate?"
Unprecedented crowding and delays on @NYCTSubway and the @MTA‚Äôs answer is placing giant solar powered trash cans (in underground stations where there‚Äôs no sun) to take up even more room on the overcrowded platform.
"MTA quote of the Monday morning: ‚ÄúI like my women like I like my water: cold and pure.‚Äù I‚Äôm sorry, sir, what the holy hell are you talking about?"
"Why is congestion pricing even a discussion right now? You can‚Äôt restrict people from driving to work if the alternative is a 2 hour commute. What we need is a complete overhaul of the MTA, then we can talk about funding infrastructure."
"It might *feel* like #TGDOTM, but it‚Äôs not. üòï However, MTA is releasing a report on the dent fare-beaters supposedly make on its bottom line.  Here is my story on that from last week.  http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2018/11/29/mta-says-fare-beaters-partially-to-blame-for-impending-nyc-fare-hikes¬†‚Ä¶"

So how is it any different from all other commutes? The MTA is nothing but criminals and incompetence.
@NYCTSubway and to boot you‚Äôre so selective with your information and responses to passengers that I - no conspiracy theorist at all - am beginning to believe that those folks u respond to are actually MTA employees.
I don't miss that shit
The worst part about being short on the subway is that people believe the space above your head is free real estate to crowd and take for their bodies - like my head is not your arm rest nor does it belong in your armpit #mta #gross ü§¢üò∑üöá
"The MTA is honestly a joke.   All the G train stations in Greenpoint are some version of closed with absolutely no warning via signage or online. Cool thx.  And apparently, as of 30m ago, F/G trains are running normally but I just waited for 25m and no train.  DO BETTER, @MTA."

Hopefully the MTA is cooperating today

Southbound A and D trains are running local from 125 St o 59 St-Columbus Circle because you should go grab a drink at your favorite bar instead.
Yo @MTA ya got the weather app or nah?... Bc clearly its not that cold outside for the heat to be on in the train.
Expect more than a 15 min delay. GCT bound trains are stopping on track 3 at Fordham which means southbound trains are using the same track as the northbound trains. Happy Monday courtesy of the MTA

The @MTA is a nightmare in regards to the #nyc subway. Stuck train at 57th & 7th? Backups for hours. Hour and a half to get 4 stops from Manhattan to Queens.

I think it would be incredibly detrimental to the likelihood of long term success to concede to such a wasteful and potentially punitive system. Look at who‚Äôs currently targeted for eüö≤ enforcement in NYC.
"Two hours and over $40 later, still not home. @MTA"
Oh I‚Äôll give ya a better one. It took me almost two hours to get home when it only takes 20 mins.

Yeah but sending a Manhattan bound 7 BACK into Queens from Queensboro plaza when the n/w isn't running still seems like a poor choice. I am going to my 2nd job and on a train now but if I make it it will be a miracle and then will the mta reimburse my lost wages?

You‚Äôre raising the price yet again in March and can‚Äôt commit to bettering the things people have been complaining about for years? The infrastructure needs to be fixed but so does the business of the MTA. There‚Äôs both gross oversight and negligence across the board.
"@MTA @NYCTSubway @NYGovCuomo how do you expect people to get from MAN. to QNS when the N, Q, R, W and 7 are all not running? 3rd time this week I‚Äôve waited well over an hour for one or several trains after a stall or signal problem on top of the regular service issues."

N/W are not running into Manhattan and the 7 is running with delays. Then the @MTA wants to raise prices. Jesus Christ this is horrific
Past two evenings MTA really fucking up my whole vibe
"My card was working until I put it in your stupid machine. The machine messed it up. That's not my fault. Plus I gave you my money, for what? I mailed in my card but how can I even trust that I'll get a new card back?"
I always feel like a *real* New Yorker when the MTA inevitably fucks up (on a Friday during rush hour no less) and I have to do a quick subway map puzzle in my head to figure out how tf to get home ü§óüôÑüíÄ
Why does the @MTA train operator pull off of a station to be held between stations and literally keep people in train cars. Don't attempt to pull into another station unless you know you can. It'll allow people to use other trains and buses to get where we need to go!
Trains are going back from Queensboro to Astoria.
I think there was something with the 7 train but I didn‚Äôt hear about any other train line.
The @MTA @NYCTSubway is a terrorist organization
Absurd waiting over 35 minutes for a Queens bound N and W train during a Friday rush hour commute. What a joke @MTA
"Okay @MTA 4 of 5 days, my commute home has been trash. Delays all the time and ""signal"" problems. Please fix your shxt."
@MTA FIX THIS SHIT!!!
On Wednesday I added 30 days to my metrocard ($121). After I took it out of the machine it stopped working. I mailed it in as instructed. Now I'm out a metrocard and you're telling me I have to waste another $5.50 to go to work everyday until I get it back? Horrible service @MTA

@MTA why do you only like the good things people tweet you. This service is worse then LAs metro system and they barley even have one. Please explain why there‚Äôs a switch malfunction and why trains are going in the opposite direction from which the riders need to go?
The @MTA should just make announcements when the 7 train is actually running without delays since that‚Äôs more of a rare occurrence lately
@MTA your service is BULLSHIT! I have been waiting 10 minutes for an F TRAIN to BROAD ST.

@MTA Why is it that your damn turnstiles eat my fare ALL THE DAMN TIME I give you more money because of your faulty systems. This is a joke. A cruel and unnecessary one
dont G trains pass like only once every 45 minutes have you been there for days?
Every. Single. Day. I need to take the train 4 stops. I have to leave over an hour before an appointment for time to adjust when my commute inevitably delays. How these MTA fools have the utter gall to propose a fare hike. I‚Äôm becoming the dude from Network.
I don‚Äôt understand why the @mta would have a work train on the tracks during rush hour

Fuck you @MTA
Every train during every rainstorm leaks from the windows and ceilings!  Any weather event destroys the commute no matter how insignificant. The staff is often rude.  The LIRR is a SERVICE and doesn‚Äôt take care of its clients. @LIRR takes advantage of its clients. #monopoly

"That system is funded totally differently, whereas the MTA has depended on fare hikes almost solely to just keep the system running. Again, London has more funding going into the system outside fares."
