Is there a number where we can directly speak to someone regarding subway and train delays? Because clearly you don’t want to problem solve on Twitter or get supervisors involved online. This is a chronic issue that should’ve been resolved years ago @MTA @NYCTSubway @NYCTBus
"Ugh, but outfront sucks. Its onthego kiosks are still awful"
70% is a good completion pct for a quarterback. It sucks for a public transportation agency charged with moving 5.6M “customers” per day. Nothing here to be proud of. Trying to spin this any any other way insults the intelligence of the “customers”
"Hey, same thing. Did you get any update on this?"
How long are we expected to wait for the bus to come? An hour for a seven minute ride? The level of disrespect you have for your customers grows each day. @MTA @NYCTSubway @NYCTBus

You know that the board wants to cut down cleaning at the beginning and end of the line?  I can only imagine what trains will look like when that happens.  Also the MTA does a deep clean of the trains every 8-10 weeks.  Just sharing.

"@MTA whoever plans the evening/night schedule for the SIM1/1c should be ashamed of themselves.  By the time a bus gets downtown there are not only no seats, but no standing room either,  or the bus just passes on by w/o stopping.  Sending the MTA my Uber bill from tonight.  😡"
They wanna legalize weed and use the tax money for the MTA ...
@MTA can you please get your shit together. Every night you have the same delayed trains at the same stop. We are paying so much money for such shitty train service. Now you wonder why people have stopped taking the trains. Cause your service delays and broke down trains.
yo @MTA u gonna reimburse me for the Uber I have to take home cause u decided to shut the G train down and the bus shuttle is currently MIA
"From May to October this year, the MTA had a monthly average of 63 “major incidents”: delays that disrupt service without warning on 50 or more trains. During the same time frame in 2017, there were nearly 68 incidents on average each month.  http://bit.ly/2SvOdZR "

One of the few good* things about the MTA! (*when taken intentionally)
"MTA already has revenue streams. Public housing is in danger of collapsing. Tenants living in serious conditions. Transit users not facing as dire a situation. They have options (eg, patience, getting up earlier, Uber, biking, etc.) Poor NYCHA tenants have limited to no options."
Didn't text coworker: I'm really McFucking drunk and you have to tell the MTA when you go to the hearing that raising single ride fares punishes people for being poor because they can't transfer as easily but the carrying cost of a mistake is meaningless on a monthly MetroCard...

@rosannascotto @ydanis @NYCSpeakerCoJo @Straphangers Perhaps we should investigate why so many people are getting struck by trains and announce solutions. Does the MTA Board members have any comments on this?
Im shook. Should i just get one of those uber pool monthly passes???

You ever get on a packed @MTA train in the am and have someones breath on your neck and question where you went wrong in life?  Just me? Ok.

Some days I love this city and other days I'm 30 minutes late to work due to no fault of my own (@MTA) & I get why people leave.
Nope parts of Coney island are transit deserts. Let's face it each borough/neighborhood has serious transit issues. All which need to be addressed. But first the MTA must blame commuters for taking transit and gumming up the works.
"yesterday, i met a young woman on the Q train, who lives in canarsie & works in the Bronx, she said it takes 1.5/2hours to get to work... she thinks she should drive be/c it would be faster #wtf #mtafail #cuomofail - city MTA “officials” get your subway shit together 🤨"

@NY1 @PIX11News @fox5ny why is it that nobody covers these stories? Is it okay for this to happen almost every day? How is it that the MTA can have these service problems and nobody addresses? @NYCTSubway @MTA

So entire in the state will pay taxes that go directly to NYC transit? Do people realize that NYC is in fact a tiny part of NY State & the rest of the state shouldn't have 2 support the city when we gave enough of our own infrastructure problems & more that NYC doesn't pay for?

Hi @MTA you just said we are being held momentarily due to a delay at 7th & 53ave and now you said it’s because of a sick passenger on the train. Are you serious? Is it possible for you to get lower with lying? Scum of a service

MTA New York City Transit President Andy Byford discusses plans for reform  http://dlvr.it/Qsv5Pt 
It's funny how fare evading is stealing money from the MTA but the actual law that allows Cuomo and NYS legislators to use the MTA funds as a random PayPal Credit account with no plans to pay it back isn't the real theft.
"7 wasn't running from Queens today, so switched to the G->L.   L got to 1st Ave, then sat there ""momentarily"" for more than 10 minutes, at which point I bailed and just walked."
"That program has been around forever, decades, and online since 2010."
"When the dust settles, I think the MTA finds itself with new funding and a narrower, operational mission. Expansion spun out into a new “economic development focused” public authority, fully state-controlled and likely run by Janno Lieber, with ability to utilize value capture.  https://twitter.com/A_W_Gordon/status/1069603104901996544 …"
Took me 45 minutes to get from our office to 57th street on the Q/R/W yesterday. Glad I gave myself 30 minutes of contingency time for a 10 minute subway ride.
Thanks @yburyug and @tdenkinger. I started with this:  https://github.com/robbiebarrat/rapping-neural-network … and then made a few tweaks but the majority of it is from that project.
2 and 5 trains have resumed. Count your blessings.
"The MTA and LIRR have stolen about 3 hours of my life this week, and it’s only Wednesday."
So New Yorkers collectively raise our voices about the clusterf**k that is #MTA and they in turn try to make us feel sorry about fare evasion?   Spare me the drama and fix the damn subways.
The MTA really changes you.
Is that why he’s asking for an arm and a leg to continue providing abysmal services?
"He's not wrong on this one.  One thing the few days of prompt door closures made obvious was how many entitled jerks stubbornly park themselves in the doorway, and what the consequences of that are.  Bummer the conductors are already backsliding."

I’ve been on countless delayed trains but this is the first time the conductor has described the traffic jam ahead as a “conga line” and told everyone to have their bosses call the MTA for an excused tardy
My trains delayed bc of an emergency brake 2 trains ahead and the conductor just told everyone to have their employers call mta for tardy slips LOL
Holy shit @mta this is a day 5 of delays each and every day. And u guys want to raise fares...
Living in NYC is leaving your house early & still being late because of MTA

The irony of being late to speak at a press conference about voting rights and access because of severe delays on the @MTA today is not lost on me. #fixthesubway or we’ll build voting power and vote for people who will.

The MTA has no moral right to police farebeaters when they cannot maintain fare-paying and collection equipment. Move to gateless entry; riders carry a pass card of whatever duration. Works all over Europe; requires minimal equipment.

@NYCTSubway @MTA @NYCMayor F subway ride back to Queens is the worst. Express train moving like molasses and stopping way to much. Fix the system. Shouldn’t take this long from the city.

"If you don’t consider the utter incompetance from Upper mgmt, greed, absurd overcosts from original spending plans, then N.J. - I feel bad for you. To blame the utter cluster F that MTA has become on fare jumpers?  I’ve admired your journalism - You should do and know better."
"Maybe I've been working in IT for too many years, but somehow … you can treat me like a second class citizen, block my way, put me in mortal danger, lie the on record, but how DARE you TAMPER with the customer satisfaction surveys! Is there nothing sacred in this world?"

They provided you with a microwave to heat your food up and they're the ones doing a bad job? Because the users (employees) don't like cleaning up after themselves? They should take that microwave away and you can eat cold food.

What's even more unacceptable is the fact that the employees who use that microwave refuse to clean up after themselves and leave food behind for roaches. Is it Andy Byford's fault that there are roaches in the microwave?

I will never understand why people rest their faces on the poles and walls of the MTA subways. You may as well dunk your head in a septic tank. 🤮
Has the @MTA tried an adopt-a-line program like highways have? Can we get corporate sponsorship of subway lines in exchange for $$$ to modernize the line’s signal system & commit to corporate volunteers monthly to clean a station on their line? Expiry when modernization complete?

"Weird. I’m a bit confused about the eagle team conversation yesterday at the finance committee meeting then. Why is the MTA paying overtime? Those are MTA personnel, not NYPD?"
This is a good question and a bit outside of my area of technical expertise. The MTA's claim is that certain lines can't run more trains without power upgrades.

I feel like ours has gotten worse and significantly neglected over the past two decades. I’ve seen improvements in some areas but the trains can no longer be trusted to be on time.
"The story isn't ""wow fare evasion has gone up"". The story is that people pay their fare, end up waiting forever and leave the system to go walk/citibike/taxi to their destination. These customers are never refunded or counted. Why is the MTA entitled to this free money?"
"“Tale of two cities” re BdB. One who takes an Escalade to the gym, the rest of us working stiffs wait 30 min in cold for a non working train 🤪"
Try paying workers to stand around doing nothing and being unhelpful. Try people finding other options cause you pay $3 for the train to brake down leading to a 20 block walk or additional $10 taxi. @MTA problem is @NYGovCuomo and @NYCMayor weak leadership and themselves.

Four A trains @mta
@MTA Local Central Park lines are ridiculous. 3 A trains have gone by in the last 10 minutes. Why don't you do something about the B&C lines?????
@MTA why does the 6 train always have the air conditioning on? It’s the winter time. #giveussomeheat
"Lol the governor siphoned more than that every year from the mta. For upstate ski lodges and to fill the budget holes elsewhere. The MTA’s dwindling finances are the sole fault of @NYGovCuomo. Don’t do his dirty work and incorrectly blame New Yorkers, Emma."
The @LIRR says it is losing about $20 million a year in unpaid fares? Well here is why. The trains are always short of cars and therefore so over crowded that it is unsafe and physically impossible for the conductors to collect the fares. 👎🏼💸@Newsday @NewsdayOpinion @MTA #LIRR pic.twitter.com/nz4uQuUE4l

@mta you don’t have enough money to provide heat in the subway yet you have billions to do unnecessary LTrain construction that ruins the neighborhood causing ppl to be ill for years? The L train tracks needed fixed. We don’t NEED a new substation or an extra entrance. @NY1

@SarahMeyerNYC @ydanis Mayor Lindsey put a cop on every train in the 60s. Where is the leadership now? Giuliani did fix this! Put cops at turnstiles & enforce the law. Tourism & Broadway will decline with tax revenue as in the ‘80s if crime does not decline.
"And they wonder why fare evasion is up. The @MTA service would be unacceptable even if it was free, it is CRAZY that they charge so much to not get anywhere on time."
J trains have resumed.

MTA - you forgot the part where you asked 700+ people to switch places with pax on a train going the different way and then ask us to switch again. The platforms were grossly overcrowded and dangerous.

There's another methodological issue.  I think they failed to look for (or control for) an interaction of paid fares x evasion rate on a per-station basis.  There are several reasons why the least-used stations would actually have the highest evasion rates.  See what happens? 1/2
"It's an interesting conundrum. But for now, I just hope the MTA keeps focusing on maintaining its infrastructure. Good service comes when things work right.   Thus ends my rant."

"It was MTA board member-& Cuomo appointee-Larry Schwartz that started this fare evasion jawboning during the MTA’s last 2 board meetings. Now it’s taken as gospel, w/dubious numbers to back it up"
Fuck mta
This is an extremely valid point. How many commuters pay their fare only to end up leaving the system without boarding a single train due to service disruptions? The MTA is gaslighting us by playing victim.
"Only the @MTA would have you waiting 20 minutes for a bus during the afternoon, while there’s no traffic. Yet they complain they’re underpaid. 🙄"
No one on the MTA board shld be in a position to make such an outrageous statement.  Time for an MTA board where the members bother to ride each branch at least once a year. #CuomosMTA https://twitter.com/A_W_Gordon/status/1069641943393714176 …

You remember that woman got sexually assaulted a few years ago and the MTA attendant said they’re not allowed to leave under any circumstances and must call the police if they witness a crime?
At the absolute least buses should be free but the MTA has hedged for years on providing data on linked trips. The general consensus is that you don’t lose a ton of paying customers making buses free and can cut costs on fare enforcement.
"In that case, how do I become an MTA board member???"

"$215 million is a bit more than 1% of the MTA's annual budget. Not trivial. But you can't get it to zero -- cutting evasion in half, to where it was a decade ago, would raise about $100 million. And how much would enforcement cost?  https://twitter.com/danrivoli/status/1069636592615243782 …"

There is a serious methodological issue here: the observers should also be required to estimate _paid_ ridership.  No way to even guess at their error rate elsewise.
Quick take on MTA farebeating presentation: the problem is more severe than I thought. But there are inherent limitations to this analysis. The MTA counted people who don't swipe. Some may have unlimiteds and are just doing the faster thing b/c they don't think it matters.
"Fear not. As I’m sitting on my REROUTED TRAIN, I had a vision - I’m going to win the lottery and buy up some buildings that these asshole people are letting sit empty for tax write-offs and fill them with artists just like the Village once was...hence the name, “Village.”"

"Fun fact: the @MTA still uses turnstiles, a technology made popular in the 1920s, rather than the more secure gating found on the #LondonTube or Boston's @MBTA.

"Use your eyes - better, have a few other Times reporters use their eyes too, in a systematic way!  At the evening rush, a huge fraction of the system's riders board at a relatively small number of busy stations.  Stand by the turnstiles and count - 4% is a flagrant fabrication."

MTA says it has lost $119 million to fare-evasion on buses and $96 million in the subway this year. That is more than double from the 2015 figure.
"There has been great debate about whether fare evasion is a major factor in dropping subway and bus ridership. The MTA says it IS a major factor -- fare evasion accounts for about 1/3 of the subway ridership decline and half of the bus decline, according to a new report."

"@NYCTSubway when you click on the status for 1,2,3 trains on  http://mta.info   right now you get status for 4,5,6.  Can the MTA not even get that right?"

"Jokes aside, this is a bit misleading; we do not know 1) the ""magnitude"" of the delays, nor 2) the scheduled time difference between trains. It's plausible that because MTA trains are (supposed to) arrive more frequently than other systems, the ""threshold"" for delays is lower."
"The MTA estimates there are 208,000 daily fare evaders in 2018 on the subway and 348,000 evaders on buses, which means a total of more than 556,000 fare evaders per day (!).   Really, really looking forward to learning how they arrived at these figures."

Schwartz wraps up the budget cut discussion saying “more can be saved out of this agency through increased productivity [&] improved efficiencies.” He doesn’t want people at the MTA to be “resting on their laurels” waiting for new revenue.

The MTA plans to stop cleaning many subway trains at both terminal ends of the trip to save costs.
This allows the MTA to reduce train frequency because trains you and I view as “too crowded” won’t be considered that way by the MTA. So more crowded less frequent trains coming in 2020.

"My train is creeping slowly through Manhattan, an almost daily affair. The MTA website says good service, though my commute is 10-15 minutes longer than it should be. Not a catastrophic delay like some of you faced this morning, but when will it get better?!"
There will be public speakers. But no sign of Mr. X. At least not yet.

Honestly if I didn’t have to take a train. If I didn’t have to deal with the @MTA I’d be happier. But I do because that’s how this city functions. They force you to rely on mass transit.

@MTA what’s wrong with downtown A trains these days??

Hey @MTA A/C in subway cars in the winter and heat in the summer is backwards. Freezing on the train. #1 car 1890
The MTA Board is holding a special finance committee meeting this morning to further discuss the authority's bleak financial outlook. They'll also get a presentation on fare evasion's impact on ridership.
"The @MTA doesn’t get much right, but they did when they hired this person.  Shout out to M train conductor Jennifer Johnston (439112). She went out of her way to explain why the E train terminates short."
It would be easier to list the ones having NO delays! Gotta love the NY MTA

The only thing the MTA is good at is sending commuters blood pressure through the roof.
I didn’t plan on being late today but I guess the MTA did.
"The MTA will be releasing some fake numbers today claiming that declining ridership is due to a massive increase in fare-hoppers. As with many things the MTA claims, take it with not just a grain, but an entire bag of salt."
It occurs to me that modified placards meet the requirements of forgery in the 2nd degree under NYS law. Bent/damaged/erased plates too. So we have thousands of @NYPDNews cops and other city employees committing D felonies daily. Nice.
"Hi- – we appreciate your report and have notified the MTA Homeless Outreach. In the future, we suggest also informing a train crew member or police officer. (1/2) ^DM"
I wish there was a way for the MTA to repay people for wasted time/money loss. Purposefully left an hour and a half early for a 45-minute train ride and I’m STILL going to be late. It’s a MONDAY MORNING. Get us where we need to go!! #NYCTSubway #MTA

Any tweet involving the MTA’s ineptitude is an evergreen tweet.
how is there a delay every FUCKING day @MTA?
"Train late, runs local instead of express, sits in station for 5 minutes with no announcement/explanation, then taken out of service due to technical difficulties. Another stellar morning commute courtesy of @mta"
"A train just got hit with the MTA Morning Rush Special.. Late train, followed up by a “taken out of service”, with a sick passenger on the side."
Southbound A and D trains are running local from 125 St o 59 St-Columbus Circle because you should go grab a drink at your favorite bar instead.
Yo @MTA ya got the weather app or nah?... Bc clearly its not that cold outside for the heat to be on in the train.
Expect more than a 15 min delay. GCT bound trains are stopping on track 3 at Fordham which means southbound trains are using the same track as the northbound trains. Happy Monday courtesy of the MTA
The only thing the @MTA is consistently good at is fucking up everyone’s day.
"@MTA if you are unable to recover from weekend maintenance in a way that doesn’t cause massive delays on multiple lines, please either a) figure that out or 2) stop work earlier on Monday mornings."

So I  not only lose valuable time w/ my kids but I’m going to have to get a sitter to walk them to school. The MTA is just flat out unreliable. I’ve lived and worked in NYC for 16 years and the decline in the last couple years is unreal. @BilldeBlasio @NYGovCuomo @MaxRose4NY 3/3
@MTA and the A went local; transfered to D at 145th; after 1 stop the D went local. 45 minutes and cant get below 125th st.
"@mta You’ve really done it this time. Sitting at 125 because my A train was taken out of service. You. Are. The. Worst. I should take my time getting to work, right?????"
"Another Day, Another MTA Delay at 125 Street."
@MTA I dont Give a Flying Fuck what Your excuses Are Waiting For the 5 train on 174 for atleast and Hour Is Inexcusable  especially on a Monday where everyone is already Dreading to go to work!!

"Another day, another subway delay. Sitting between stations (68th and 59th in Bay Ridge). No announcement, just not moving for 5 min, and counting. The only reliable thing about the MTA is the unreliability. This is how it affects me. 1/3"
And yet there’s going to be a fair hike? I’m about to be 30 minutes late for work when I left early. Thanks @MTA.  https://twitter.com/nyctsubway/status/1069557739737804800 …

Another morning with 18+ minute waits during morning rush hour.  @MTA (Queens- bound G train from Greenpoint Ave)  pic.twitter.com/5oHwfeRNLl
It’s time New York legalized and embraced electric scooters and bikes. We need an alternative to the MTA especially with the L train closure in April. The Subways are a mess with delays and closures of lines like the F train on weekends. It’s excruciating.#Subway

This downtown A train is making local stops after 168th but we could barely fit any more passengers on here at 168th. It’s not even 8am @mta!! And it’s only Monday. And you’re raising fares in the spring...right? 🤬🤬🤬 @unsuckMTA
"Hey fellow New Yorkers: anyone else still bitter about that squandered MTA budget surplus from 2003, or is it just me?"
"Hey @MTA, why are you SO terrible????"
"Well, I'm on an F train now, but the MTA website is still suggesting people take other trains or busses because of extensive delays. We'll see how long this takes me."
It's Not A New York Morning Without The MTA Breaking Down :) SMH
"A train service has resumed after we pressed the ""subway work good"" button."
And the B61 bus just sailed by us so we have to wait 10 minutes. I dare the @MTA to face the angry crowd here.

The MTA never fails to provide harrowing adventures. Since my 4 hour journey from the UWS to Brighton Beach I've learned to pack snacks when I venture out on the weekends.
tired of these games the mta loves to play
Does MTA have gift cards bc THATS what I want for the holidays
"@MTA Pls fix the B13 line, its so bad in terms of time , its been like this for at least 10 years at least make it so that it comes on time. On Google maps its says arrival at 5:01 when its not even close it comes at 5:30 idk if its the bus drivers on this route  for past years.."
The @MTA should be embarrassed by what they provide on weekends.   Truly a cluster of a mess

"I love the @MTA because they shut down all Astoria N/W stops & left only one lane for traffic by Bdway so the shuttle sat there &  I ran to the R, the R was running on the F but then after 34 was running on the Q while the Q is running on the R. But yes let’s pay Amazon billions."

Get to Q platform to see 17 min wait. Are you asking us to riot in the stations & the streets? pic.twitter.com/a8u7a4Sc7F
Yeah I couldn’t remember if that was there before..?!
F train service has resumed. Count your blessings.
This is why @MTA is in the situation that they're in this is why you're losing ridership because you're undependable and it's getting worse that's the reason why everybody takes taxis in use Uber and Lyft always late not on time
MTA really fuckin with me. First the M was closed at W 4th and then the J was closed at Delancey. 🙄
It took me 2hrs to get home on the subway tonight so Mikey wrote the MTA a strongly worded email.
"Hey, MTA, there are other possible improvements west of Eighth Avenue  http://dlvr.it/QsXn5D "
"An elevator just went out of service at the 34 St - Penn station, which serves the #1 #2 #3 #L lines. It is the one that is on the mezzanine to downtown local platform."
"When the @MTA makes ya go downtown to 59th to go uptown to 125th to then take the downtown local ya find yaself back on the fucking bus & kicking yaself for not taking @ridewithvia also, #imissmybike. pic.twitter.com/FHFS1fjoW9"
Shuttle Bus dez nuts MTA!!
No Sim3C busses running the entire 10pm hour tonight? Is this the new forgotten bus line? @MTA @NYCTBus how is it justified to raise fares? Find the money somewhere else.
"The ticket machines at Nostrand Avenue are temporarily out of service today, 11/30 through 6 PM Saturday 12/1 due to station renovations. Please purchase tickets using the MTA eTix app or at one of the 24/7 ticket windows at Atlantic Terminal or Jamaica."
"Soon there will be apps for fun things to do while waiting on a subway platform for a delayed train, like, How To Plan for the Hour of Your Date Spent On the MTA because of Cuomo’s Negligence.  Hope you’re having a fun Friday evening @NYGovCuomo, and you too @NYCMayor."
u make me want to die @MTA
I can't tell you how many times I walked on the subway sideways like some kinda Chesapeake crab before the MTA put down those tutorial Arthur Murray footprints.
"The @MTA is so great...she says, sarcastically. #ShuttleHell"
Why do New Yorkers pay so much for unreliable train service...#MTA is the absolute worst

@MTA we need widespread paper notices at every station that *could* be effected by weekend work. This last week has been horrible.   How can you even contemplate raising prices when you don’t provide the basic service you claim to?
Southbound N trains are running with delays because we replaced all trains with golf carts
I take the MTA but they all suck.
Hey @MTA been waiting at 42nd St Bryant Park and still waiting for uptown service at least 25min what is going on🤦‍♂️

Fuck the @MTA for running the Q train as if it's Sunday. You just turned the fastest train to Brooklyn to the slowest and it's not the weekend.
"@NYCMayor @NYGovCuomo NYC’s current ban on throttle e-bikes is a national embarrassment. What does it matter if you pedal or push a button if you’re going under 20mph? Pro tip: If you’re going to ban a viable mode of transportation, fix the @MTA first."

@mta @NYCTSubway why do you always cancel the J without telling anyone or providing any alternatives?? You owe me $40.

The state runs the MTA but it wasn't something that was anyone's fault because this was caused by Sandy. The tunnels under the East River was flooded and the salt water did damage.

Same at Bryant park
@MTA  I'm going to be at least a half an hour late when I should have been 15 minutes early. Then you're raising the fair to $3.00 & you expect people to believe in you.

"@MTA I'm going to say this again, when I loose my job because you guys are so unfuckin reliable. I hope I can live with 1 of u. I'm going to Ludlow St. J not running . Take the M. The M's not going to Ludlow. I have to get off @ Hewes to take a shuttle bus over the bridge."
Sweet thanks #mta for now making us walk home.  Love the cold wind and cancellations
"Nah it's cool #mta, waiting at the station for 5+ minutes is totally normal"
"Not only wait in between station, but wait at the stations as well.  15 minutes to go 8 blocks, 20 mins between trains #mta.  Great job"

"I really gotta stop slandering MTA buses, cuz idk what it is but these drivers really be looking out for ya girl! This is the 2nd time a bus that I wasn’t waiting for stopped for me and drove me somewhere for free 💃🏾"
It was fine last Saturday and it's set to be good tomorrow. They're just playing MTA whack-a-mole at this point.

I think it would be incredibly detrimental to the likelihood of long term success to concede to such a wasteful and potentially punitive system. Look at who’s currently targeted for e🚲 enforcement in NYC.
"Two hours and over $40 later, still not home. @MTA"
Oh I’ll give ya a better one. It took me almost two hours to get home when it only takes 20 mins.

"Hey, it's Friday. We at the MTA like having fun with our customers. Just sit back and enjoy the ride and please help us celebrate our upcoming fare hike (scheduled for 2019). Tell your friends"
What’s going on at the Brooklyn Bridge @MTA stuck in deadlock traffic on the QM25 at Beckman Street in Manhattan
Tonight's @MTA disaster of an evening commute into Queens brought to you by #AmazonCuomosMTA. #AmazonCuomosMTA: Because let's raise subway fares while giving Jeff Bezos a helipad.
.@MTA so are you going to run any trains to Queens tonight?
Yeah but sending a Manhattan bound 7 BACK into Queens from Queensboro plaza when the n/w isn't running still seems like a poor choice. I am going to my 2nd job and on a train now but if I make it it will be a miracle and then will the mta reimburse my lost wages?
We at the MTA strive for consistency. Two days in a row of stalled trains on the same line means we're doing better. Please enjoy our upcoming fare hike (scheduled for March 2019)

"*the MTA not the person reading this tweet, thanks for doing this shitty job"
#MTA PLEASE explain why you cannot handle a stalled train@ 57th and 7th?? Hundreds (probably thousands at this point) of people stranded trying to get to Queens. You are literally responsible for people being late to their lives. What’s the status?????
"Unbelievable! Great work MTA. From Monday to Friday, you never failed to impress me with how incompetent you are! 👏🏻"
"Twice in under 20 hours, the entire R/N/W line is having a complete meltdown cuz of issues in Midtown and I'm going nowhere fast. But please, @MTA, let's talk some more about fare hikes and the mind-boggling mystery of why ridership is declining."
I have an idea. How about we put the #mta in charge of snow removal and the    DOT in charge of trains? Can't be any worse right? #stuckat59onafridaynight. #astoria #lic
Who runs the @MTA #MTA lazy organization. Get your act together. #nycsubways #thirdworldcountry
The MTA is my 2nd favorite thing  My first favorite thing is cancelling plans and staying home
"I miss praising the 1 line’s consistently reliable service as we’re charged premium price for third-rate service. @NYGovCuomo since you’re not going to be focusing on a 2020 run, can you please start focusing on fixing the MTA."
You’re raising the price yet again in March and can’t commit to bettering the things people have been complaining about for years? The infrastructure needs to be fixed but so does the business of the MTA. There’s both gross oversight and negligence across the board.
"@MTA @NYCTSubway @NYGovCuomo how do you expect people to get from MAN. to QNS when the N, Q, R, W and 7 are all not running? 3rd time this week I’ve waited well over an hour for one or several trains after a stall or signal problem on top of the regular service issues."

"@NYCTBus @MTA driver for the Sim3 that just left 23rd st & Park didnt pull over @ the stop,  about 15 feet ahead in the bus lane. I knocked on the door Nd he shook his head & said ""No"". So rude, so unprofessional & its raining.   I'll see him again and give him a piece of my mind"
"maybe if you pay more for your fare the trains will work. worth a try. don’t you dare take Uber though, they’re taking fares away from the MTA!"
@NYCTSubway @MTA are any Queens-bound trains coming to the 49th Street station in Manhattan? There's no info and no sign of any coming
@MTA another train delay on the n/r/w? Really? Is nyc a third world country?
Just wait until the summer time when there is even more people

Second day in a row with this line. The mta is a disgrace
Any announcements at the station as to why the train passed you by like you don't matter?
SIR service has resumed after we cancelled our dance party :(
"Cool. Please explain to me why MTA employees aren't more diligent about letting people know about these delays BEFORE they swipe their metro cards. A muddled and infrequent announcement is not enough. If turnstile hopping is a crime, shouldn't stealing ppls $ also be a crime?"

Currently stranded on a w train in midtown and the conductor says we’re moving and we’ll see how far we can get. Gotta love the #mta and a 3 hour commute home.
"@NYCTSubway so basically there’s no way in or out of Queens. N, R, and W are severely delayed too because of a stall at 57th and 7th.  MTA fail 👎"
@MTA 5 working days (4days straight getting home  getting so Late) 7 trainCOME AND YOU WANT RAISE THE FARE?? THE SERVICE...SUCKS.🤬💩
"MTA New York City Transit, please stop being so bad at your job.   Maybe instead of a $150 million dollar cosmetic fix to the Astoria subway stations you could have fixed actual infrastructure. Or updated the signaling in the tunnels. Or... Or... Or..."
#mta will you pay for my uber as there is literally no way to get to ditmars from lex??
Yeah they’re shuttling between Astoria and Queensboro
"Sitting on the W. Conductor says “This Astoria bound train will not be going to Astoria.” So no N/W/R service going into Queens. But hey, let’s give Amazon a $2billion tax cut instead of fixing the @MTA am I right? #NYC #mta"
@MTA what’s going on with the R?
At least the @MTA is consistent at SUCKING!!!
"Do you favor the privatizing the MTA?? or, selling off pieces and allowing than to compete?"
"Have to call @MTA customer service, and if possible, it’s in even worse shape than the MTA itself... it’s almost comical but then I remember how much state and city income tax is here 😳"
Legit decided to go to a bar instead of trying to get back into astoria. @MTA @NYCTSubway @andrewcuomo you guys need to handle our metro better. #Friyay pic.twitter.com/9ZPeXiCPgr
N/W are not running into Manhattan and the 7 is running with delays. Then the @MTA wants to raise prices. Jesus Christ this is horrific
Past two evenings MTA really fucking up my whole vibe
"My card was working until I put it in your stupid machine. The machine messed it up. That's not my fault. Plus I gave you my money, for what? I mailed in my card but how can I even trust that I'll get a new card back?"
I always feel like a *real* New Yorker when the MTA inevitably fucks up (on a Friday during rush hour no less) and I have to do a quick subway map puzzle in my head to figure out how tf to get home 🤗🙄💀
Why does the @MTA train operator pull off of a station to be held between stations and literally keep people in train cars. Don't attempt to pull into another station unless you know you can. It'll allow people to use other trains and buses to get where we need to go!
Trains are going back from Queensboro to Astoria.
I think there was something with the 7 train but I didn’t hear about any other train line.
The @MTA @NYCTSubway is a terrorist organization
Absurd waiting over 35 minutes for a Queens bound N and W train during a Friday rush hour commute. What a joke @MTA
"Okay @MTA 4 of 5 days, my commute home has been trash. Delays all the time and ""signal"" problems. Please fix your shxt."
@MTA FIX THIS SHIT!!!
On Wednesday I added 30 days to my metrocard ($121). After I took it out of the machine it stopped working. I mailed it in as instructed. Now I'm out a metrocard and you're telling me I have to waste another $5.50 to go to work everyday until I get it back? Horrible service @MTA
"My F train needed a jump(?!), according to the conductor. The MTA is a modern marvel."
I was just in France using their TGV system. NJT is a third world system in comparison. And MTA subway is total crap compared to somewhere like Berlin.
"An elevator just went out of service at the 57 St - 7 Av station, which serves the #N #Q #R #W lines. It is the one that is on the mezzanine to street."
@mta the C train on 168 going downtown is so disgusting!! TRASH AND FOOD EVERYWHERE IN EACH CART!! Wtf!
Why is it always the days I feel the worst that the MTA runs like dogshit? #justwannagohome
"MTA machine ate my $10, cute cute"
34 St-bound 7 trains will end at Times Sq-42 St or Queensboro Plaza because variety is the spice of life

@MTA Friday night rush hour and no N/W trains NOW no 7 trains?! HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GET TO SUNNYSIDE?!
@NYCTSubway @MTA You are a god damn mess. You wait until the second after your conductor closes the doors at 42nd to tell people the N train is going 96th and you should go back 42nd and grab a 7. But wait! The 7 is also not moving. Glad you want to raise the fares. #mtasucks
@mta so 20 minutes waiting for a Queens bound n or w on 59th and 5th avenue. Delay upon delays
You had one job @mta

The trains don't run reliably or well. The MTA's solution: Make transfers worse and answer fewer questions!  https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-metro-conductor-subway-doors-20181127-story.html …
The burden/cost of running such a scheme would not generate enough profit for anyone to get into the business and/or the level of effort/$ for the customer would just depress usage to the point where there would be 0 meaningful Transportation impact.

Yup. And with reduced tax revenue to improve the system! SO SMART.
I love the @MTA’s new thing of greeting passengers as they exit the station in the morning.   I also love the smell of human feces in the morning.
"Yes, I could have left a video comment, but it is only open from 7-10 at Ronkonkoma. I'm on the 6:08. The stupid train is going to make me late enough for work. Am I supposed to go in late for this? I DID leave a comment on the website, but do they read those?"

@MTA why do you only like the good things people tweet you. This service is worse then LAs metro system and they barley even have one. Please explain why there’s a switch malfunction and why trains are going in the opposite direction from which the riders need to go?
The @MTA should just make announcements when the 7 train is actually running without delays since that’s more of a rare occurrence lately
@MTA your service is BULLSHIT! I have been waiting 10 minutes for an F TRAIN to BROAD ST.

dont G trains pass like only once every 45 minutes have you been there for days?
Every. Single. Day. I need to take the train 4 stops. I have to leave over an hour before an appointment for time to adjust when my commute inevitably delays. How these MTA fools have the utter gall to propose a fare hike. I’m becoming the dude from Network.
I don’t understand why the @mta would have a work train on the tracks during rush hour

"The @MTA is trying to increase #fares to those who pay, but everyday thousands of people in #NYC avoid to pay the fare in #buses and #subways effortlessly. You should do something about that FIRST before making us keep pay for your mismanagement. @NYCMayor @nycgov"
Ahh the joys of being stuck underground on the 7 train for 40mins...😒 thanks @MTA for making my commute joyous 😤
"Serious question @NYCTBus @MTA how safe is the bus when it's so packed the driver can't open the doors to let people on and off. Please fix the Q41 bus route, it's dangerous to have this many people on one bus."
@MTA stalled 7 train at Grand Central @ 8am. You guys are unbelievable. Thanks for making EVERYONE be late to wherever they are going. You guys suck

@mta @NYCTBus no b60 at Williamsburg Plaza since at least 5:15. Should have been TWO by now.
"We do it because there's no guarantee that the next train will actually show up in time and we afraid of being stranded waiting. Don't blame the player, blame the game (or the @MTA )"

OH for clarification....that’s Me in my Uber passing the @MTA
The @MTA @NYCTSubway should reimburse people for the appointments they miss when there simply aren’t enough trains running in the morning
Its a done deal. This is all smoke and mirrors. The State of New York is now run by Democrats from top to bottom. This hike will go through and there is nothing we can do about it. This is why we never hear about folks who live in the south retiring and moving to NY.
Nit: Want our money implies we have a voice in the matter.

these stalled f trains made me miss my doctor appoint and probably be late to my job interview today. thanks @MTA for never working and letting us down with your failing @NYCTSubway system. wanna send in an explanation note to the company i’m interviewing?
So why did the B train just make everyone get off at Prospect Pk saying its out of service only to sit here and not move outta the station for the next train??? RIDICULOUS MTA
Yo @MTA wtf now. This dispatcher just told us 3 different excuses as to why we stuck on the bridge. #1. Emergency break then #2. Train traffic. #3 Imvestigation at west 4th. Wtffffffffffff bro been on this bridge for 15 min already. Y’all don’t give a fuck about no one time.
Not surprised
A train service has resumed because we actually repaired something. Shocking!
The mta needs to be more mindful of ppl who suffer from anxiety and/or claustrophobia. There’s ALWAYS a stall between Nostrand ave and Hoyt on the A to Manhattan at rush hour on very packed trains. Wtf!! Horrible service. These rides aren’t free. It’s expensive! @NYCTSubway
Yet another morning where I have to decide whether to walk 45 min to work or sit on a busted train. Thanks @MTA

Fuck you @MTA
Every train during every rainstorm leaks from the windows and ceilings!  Any weather event destroys the commute no matter how insignificant. The staff is often rude.  The LIRR is a SERVICE and doesn’t take care of its clients. @LIRR takes advantage of its clients. #monopoly

"The @MTA won’t make a push for a commuter tax on the wealthiest New Yorkers. Instead, they’ll ask @NYPDTransit to harass poor Black and Latinx commuters.

Dear @MTA please put signs up at Barclays that the 4/5 don't stop on the 4/5 track at night. When 500+ people are on that track after a Nets game a few signs might help instead of seeing your train pull up on the 2/3 track.

You are increasing congestion and endangering cyclists! pic.twitter.com/5JR9kgN9Is
can’t stand hearing people complain about wackass @MTA — how have you used your voice / vote to do something about it?
"It's not fare beaters that are coating the system to hike fares. Let's put the cards on the table. Ask former governor Pataki, former mayor Guiliani about the 400 mill they each cut from the MTA budget? Ask Cuomo and Sheldon Silver how much their pet project cost the MTA?"

"And, bc time is a flat circle, the @NYCTSubway #Mtrain we eventually caught held in tunnel before 63rdDrive- @MTA conductors blame it on ‘train in station ahead of us.’  The train before this on this track had a 10-min headway, so that’s inaccurate."
"I voted for you, don’t make me regret it. Fix the #mta #pricehike"
WHAT IS GOING ON AT THE 96TH ST 1/2/3 STATION AT LEAST MAKE THE ANNOUNCEMENTS AUDIBLE @MTA

"It’s incredible that, after the year the @mta has had, and the changes they SAY they’ve made, their basic Customer Service Policy is ‘🤷🏻‍♂️.’"
"It’s jaw-dropping.  We sat close enough to #JacksonHeights to have cell signal, so, the @MTA conductors did too, but they still fed their @NYCTSubway paying customers garbage information."

Dear MTA.  J train crawling crawling its way thru Manhattan towards Brooklyn @MTA @NYCTSubway   more signal problems again? Car 3059
Southbound 2 and 3 trains are running with delays because you still live in New York City
"Bother fucking day waiting for a 2 train and seeing legit 5 fucking 5 trains going to the same place every 3 mins. My nigga, NOBODY lives on the 5 line. No one important. Why the fuck is this a thing. Can’t ask MTA cus they all m lost in the city sauce."
"AFTER all that, the @MTA conductor responsible for car 9614 FINALLY gets on the PA to tell us about a red signal ahead.  We’re about to miss a 2nd local connection, and after that it’s a 10-min gap until the next one.  @NYCTSubway Service in #Queens after 7pm is a joke."

"Hi there, could you send us a picture of those signs? Was it an MTA employee posting them? ^EH"
roughly 100% sure the outdated L train closure signs i just watched someone put up at 3rd ave is a tactic to confuse the masses in advance of future chaos @MTA pls unleash ur wrath in a timely manner thank u
N/Q/R line had substantial service changes messing w my commute home 3 days in a row. Such consistently bad service + looming fare hikes hurt most for riders w/ no other option. And will hurt the @MTA too when riders who DO have a choice take cars instead.  🤬🤬🤬cc @RidersNY

"That system is funded totally differently, whereas the MTA has depended on fare hikes almost solely to just keep the system running. Again, London has more funding going into the system outside fares."

Great news @NYCTSubway and @MTA we moved a little bit but now we are STILL stuck on the bridge. Thought I’d check back in just in case you can HAAALP PLS this is such bad service :(
@MTA we are on a D train that has stopped for at least 15 minutes over and over again. No announcements. This is looking like it’s going to be a two hour trip (double my normal commute). Do you consider this adequate service?
This train betta hurry up! @ MTA - 42nd St/Times Square Subway Station  https://www.instagram.com/p/BdgpX9RHZrUpYVjJM2LPd7dloueuWJ9lqlsXS40/ …
