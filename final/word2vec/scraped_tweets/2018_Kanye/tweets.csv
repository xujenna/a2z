a generation of critics and fans REALLY did a lot of the heavy lifting of giving Kanye’s politics a nuance they didn’t have. also he had a host of writers who sanded down the edges that sadly aren’t around anymore.

"correct me if i’m mistaken xxxtentacion influenced one of the greatest artists today, kanye west. ariana just sang about her X and played victim. she didn’t influence nothing. please stop.  https://twitter.com/tclkfastlive/status/1071596971876630529 …"
"True but neither are major alt right movements in the US. In fact it’s seeing the Dieudonne phenomenon that made me understand what was happening w Trump early on. They prioritize anger and simple solutions over all else, including their own racism. It’s the Kanye defense."
"i don’t know if it was unconscious or not, but usually i spend a couple weeks going back through kanye’s discography for nostalgia’s sake and that did not happen this year lol. the shenanigans kinda tore down the veil on his past bars."

And that’s the problem cause Kanye doesn’t book shit for anybody.
"Mind you all you brought up was she loved him. I never once even said that, I simply said she’s profiting from a horrible situation when others are doing similar things but donating all proceeds. Logically that would make Kanye mighty saintly and her not so much"
"There are levels to this shit, it’s not like they were kosher and then Mac died and she just wants to make a song. He was at his lowest, probably was brought down lower, died, now she’s profiting. Kanye ain’t profiting, they ain’t even date. Why is she?"
Man it's unfortunate that some hating person dug up a past remark that you made to YOUR son. I am a huge fan of yours and I am also a gay man who will continue to be your fan as long as you don't Kanye out lol... They need to be speaking about Mandarin #45 aka Donald Dump

I mean I think after they made that commercial featuring Taylors speech after the whole Kanye incident they picked her side imo
Yeah but Kanye released a couple things this year too that didn’t get any love and they’ve been iffy with Kanye in the past too I honestly think they were just off pop music this year and geared more toward rap as a whole I don’t think it was personal against Taylor

Mac getting a new gf right after the break up means he was sad. But Ariana rushing into an engagement after the breakup means she broke macs heart again. Make that make sense

Personally I don’t care who shines a light on this issue. Why we always explaining to these scary folks that will always be scared of the so call bogeyman .
Likely words coming from someone name Tom.
"Great interview. Very important. I grew up in Baltimore and I think Meek is the perfect voice in this conversation. He’s experienced the system first hand, it’s meant to get people down and out."
Kevin Hart BEEEEN a coon and you don’t have to wear a MAGA hat like Kanye to be one. He BEEN passive aggressively tap dancing for years
Meek Mill makes good points. He needs to align himself with other peeps of color who are fighting this fight for equal justice.
"You sound sorta racist in this conversation, Michael. Check your #privilege. And maybe listen to this season’s @serial or watch @ava ‘s #thirteenth for how the criminal justice system “works” for people of color. It’s a system from #slavery to #JIMcrow to the prison system."
Meek Mill clearly doesnt know what he talking about .. How about he sit down with @kanyewest @realDonaldTrump If he really want to make change .. His handlers won't allow that
Why is it that Kanye is used to combat armies in Atlanta?
Sorry but Kanye’s verse on “One Minute” doesn’t belong.
Daytona is rap at its best? lol  Mac rapped way better on Swimming than Push did on there. Swimming’s production & beats are a thousand times better than those 7 beats Kanye made in 3 hours (you can tell)  https://twitter.com/savage_kenny98/status/1071408187943870464 …

Kanye did a lot and......so.....  https://twitter.com/singhclairr/status/1070797626935779333 …
So was the point of this to completely disregard that Kanye has been an artist longer than Ariana and that his past success doesnt determine current impact or the quality current work? Because that’s the only way it matters.

James we aren't too happy with Black Kanye at the moment so be White Drake or White Future for the moment until the heat dies down. Hell I'll even accept a White Fetty Wap #PumpRules
you've convinced me to bone up on Drake. I confess only song I really know is 'hell yeah fuckin right' and because I loved the bar mitzvah video. I don't really know Lil Wayne Drake Common Wiz Khalifa et al. I barely know Kanye West. I go up to around 50 Cent era circa 2004ish.
Normally a seemingly straight man buying another seemingly straight man expensive underwear would be creepy AF but with Jax using it as an olive branch with James was kinda touching too bad James had to ruin it by being White Kanye #PumpRules

It's true! I'm looking into it now! Fans do often tag her thinking they're tagging Jimin from BTS. I guess it is an understandable misunderstanding for new fans.
It actually does make sense. Sadly. Many fans mistakenly tag Jimin Park thinking they're tagging Jimin of BTS. So it is completely possible that Jimin Park made the list this way.

Just trying to get you to understand why some people wouldn’t consider what he said to be an apology. There’s more than one way to interpret what he said. I’m cool with his response & said so from the beginning. Hope this makes sense.
"Hey Twitter, based on the fact that BTS is at the top of this list, I'm pretty sure #8 there is Park Jimin of @BTS_twt (who does not have a personal Twitter). The Park Jimin you've mentioned here is not correct in that case. This is why we need that edit button!"
Thanks! I’m looking into it.

That tweet from the actor at The Cher Show to Kanye proves my point that musicals are more fun to be in than to watch 😬
Kanye let his talent speak first for years then he went on to say/do dumb shit.
She a Gemini. She will speak her truth until it kills her. She don’t care about the fame and what not. She wants her respect and talent to be her mouth. But as a female that’s not allowed. Hence why she wants to able to talk her shit. Like Kanye the male Gemini

"BREAKING: Here's what a random pedestrian secretly said to Kanye: ""A diamond sword smells like cats."""
"Again, I said I don't care about Kanye because he wasn't a topic in this conversation. We were talking about Nicki and Cardi. You said Nicki doesn't write, I told you she does. You said she doesn't write good, we know she does I told you Cardi doesn't, I'm a bully. Delusion."
The one w/ Kanye is cool hearing him on a rock song is different but idk the leak might be fake i hope it is cause it’s garbage
"Did I say it was only Cardi that doesn't write? Did I even start the talk about writing raps?Reading and comprehension is fundamental. You discredited Nicki's pen and I had to tell you Cardi doesn't have. Drake, Kanye or whomever doesn't write were not included in this convo"
"I don't care about Kanye... Cardi claims she writes her own rap. Watch her interviews. I don't really care about her. And Nicki writes all of her raps. When you write, not everything will be good. A few ""flops"" doesn't mean someone else has been doing it for you.."

"The thing is he never said “I’m sorry” or “I was wrong.” He said “pardon my lack of etiquette.” That could easily be taken more that Kanye was asking to be excused rather than genuinely being sorry for disrupting. I believe Kanye meant it as a gracious apology & for him, it was."

White people get off on controlling black people. This is not in defense of Kanye. It just is what it is.
This nice.
THANK YOU KANYE VERY COOL
Kanye dress me up like a doll
"Thank you for calling him out! What an asshole! Kanye...that is, not you wonderful performers!! Congrats on opening night. Here's to a long glorious run, with no assholes attached to their phones in the audience! xx"
"I was doing a play the other night and afterwards an older white guy and younger woman of color were arguing fairly loudly, later I discovered he was telling her during the perf to put her phone away, her ultimate response to the older guy was ""I have a life"""
"That was a more plesant reply than I wouldve gave, Mr.West."

I gottaaa
Mind everyone's business? Dude is in the fucking play. Kanye was literally in the man's business.
And that is all we ask as actors and audience members!!
It is im not denying that one of kanye’s early successes was harnessing that same thing the 🐻 wearing the air mags the numerous references to stuff that only kids who grew up in his era would get so you could see how coming from three albums catered to me to me ina way
I am so sorry that you have to deal with these morons who don’t respect art #stayhome

Why are people so completely and totally oblivious to BASIC manners and common decency in the theater?!? GET OFF YOUR PHONE!!
Kanye the exception
I mean this is just from my point of view and i was a kanye stan before but i feel after the first three albums it was just hard for me to connect with his subject matter i mean not alot of people can say during college dropout u were contemplating dropping out of college  u kno

He was ignorant before but now he’s on Kardashians show.
I checked my phone once at a move theatre. Nobody called me out on Twitter. But oh kanye!
The burden of the longstanding Kanye fan (present company included-ish/tbd these days) is that you always have to look in the details to understand the context of why he ever does what he does
It was on The Today Show and The View. I saw it.
"That’s your opinion but just consider the actor felt it was the only way to get Kanye to stop without disrupting the show for the entire cast and audience. If the show had been disrupted and Kanye called out, we’d have heard about it, one way or another."
"Jay-Z has valid songs and verses throughout his career but in terms of full body projects his only good ones front to back with replay value was blueprint 3, watch the throne, and Magna Carta which is all lost Kanye no cap"
"Finally Kanye, something you handled well!!"

Um I’m like 90% sure I had a dream about Kanye being at a Cher concert on his phone like 3 years ago. Shall I call myself a psychic or is that aggressive since I’m not 100% sure??

"Okay, but you should try to understand that cell phone use is not permitted & will not be tolerated, regardless of who it is. Actors do stop shows for it & shouldn’t have to! There is no way his or anyone’s prolonged use of a phone was going to just be ignored. Come to Broadway."

I liked a @YouTube video  http://youtu.be/nhqqamnpFqo?a  JAY-Z Explains ‘What’s Free’ Kanye Lyric
Exactly.
Why would you think that saying it to the crowd wouldn’t have brought national attention to Kanye from using his phone on opening night when celebrities and critics were in the audience? There was no way this incident was going to be unnoticed in the media one way or another.
"Also, if @kanyewest didn’t care or respect the culture of theatre, he wouldn’t be there. To insinuate that he was deliberately being disrespectful for the very thing that he was there to support, is a reach. Let the man be. He’s human. He made a mistake. And lastly, he apologized"
I dont agree with this at all but kanye’s music has fallen off for sure

Leave it to Kanye to steal the thunder from opening night by disrespecting the stated rules of NO CELL PHONE USE during the performance! That’s all everyone is talking about today! Kudos to you for getting his attention the only way you could short of stopping the show!

when you enter the theatre you turn your phone off until the show is over. It’s pretty simple babe.
Do you....do you think he just stares at his phone waiting to see if there is an emergency with his children? Do you think that there were no other parents in that audience?

Yes. He was most likely the only rude person looking at his phone for a long enough time to distract wonderful people from doing their job. So yes.
So ask your cousin how they felt when people were on their phones during the show. I’m gonna guess they support @jarrodspector and his perspective.

The best is all the people in those comments who are like LOOK KANYE PROBABLY HAS IMPORTANT THINGS GOING ON ALL THE TIME AND NEEDS TO BE ON HIS PHONE
All were asked not to be on their phone during the show as is the rule in live theater. It is considered disruptive and people can be asked to leave with no refund for doing so.
Aww that's a bummer. Luckily I have rarely seen that at a broadway show. And then they were asked to turn it off
I never said whether it's cool just pointing out that the issue is being on the phone in the theater during a show when all are requested not to....qnd not being backstage and on phone where one is not disrupting the show.

"If the theater asked Kanye to leave, it could have been on TV news & been more humiliating to get called out in the theater. They always tell everyone TURN OFF YOUR PHONES before the show starts. Kanye should respect the rules. He gave a gracious apology. Hopefully he learned."
Of course you put Meek on the show. What else would a network who loves dancing niggas to do? #thankyoumassa

"Not really...it was DURING the show, why TF would the actor leave from back stage to go into the audience lmao. Either way, Kanye saw the tweet and he replied respectfully, no need to attack the broadway actor when he did nothing wrong lmao. You guys just love to suck Kanyes cock"
this actor went on twitter to call out kanye for using his cellphone while sitting in the audience at opening night of the cher show. awesomeness in a tweet:  https://twitter.com/jarrodspector/status/1069753066033987584 …
what kanye album should i listen to tonight hmmm replytweet
you rock and not just cuz you're playin sonny
"It takes a lot to make me geek out. On a night where I was in extremely close proximity to Cher, Kim and Kanye, Kathy Griffin, Keegan-Michael Key, and more, it was seeing Barbara Corcoran, my favorite Shark, up close that really threw me for a loop."
I go to many Broadway shows and I’ve seen actors call people out all the time on social media. Ushers in the theatre be yelling at people all the time too for being on their phones lmaoo. No one gets a pass
#tbt me and the guy from the cher show who yelled at kanye  pic.twitter.com/5wvejKLsXr
Just because someone is successful it doesn’t give them a pass to be a dick. Broadway shows are way different than concerts that you people are used to. It’s disrespectful to talk/sing/record/be on cell phone during ANY broadway shows.
Broadway is a whole different scene to these people. They think it’s like a concert where you can talk/sing/take pics during the show lmao
"If was that important then he can go to the lobby of the theatre and go on his phone, it’s not just Kanye that has been called out before lmao. Audience members get called out all the time for being on their phones"
Such a baby
Jesus...
It’s not ignorant at all tf. You’ve clearly never been to a broadway show before. It’s disrespectful to be on your phone. It may not seem like a big deal to you Kanye cocksuckers cause you guys don’t attend Bway shows. Its NOT like a concert where u can be on ur phone n take pics
Search up what theatre etiquette is because you Kanye Cocksuckers have NO IDEA what it is at all...Broadway shows are NOT CONCERTS.
He’s not an insecure douchebag at all lmao. Clearly you’ve never been to a Broadway show. You’re not supposed to be on ur phone it’s distracting for other audience members and to the actors on stage. Being on ur phone may not seem like a big deal but it’s obvious to see on stage
Also I would kill for any era Kanye to be on my show. He’s on some next level shit right now but MAGA Kanye was probably the most incredible thing to happen in pop culture maybe of all time
Not really. Broadway actors call audience members out all the time on social media. Broadway shows aren’t concerts where you can do whatever you want. There’s something called theatre etiquette. Not going to expect you Kanye cocksuckers to know what that is
My life can easily be split in to before hearing Lift Yourself and after hearing Lift Yourself. I’ll never be able to describe listening to what I thought was gonna be a the first new Kanye song in 2 years and then that nonsense being dropped on me

Y’all: Kanye never acknowledges when he has done something wrong.  Ye: Please pardon my lack of etiquette. We have so much appreciation for the energy you guys put into making this master piece.  Y’all: He was singing too?
"The man’s next most popular tweet has 50 likes, look at how much attention he got. If you can’t see past that I don’t what to say to you."
"Or, it speaks volumes about how annoying Kanye's phone screen was. Tomayto Tomahto. While this has been fun, I have work tomorrow, so I'll leave you with this... Go G-Men!"
every single day kanye just proves even more that he’s trash huh
Meh... he's a Tony nominated Broadway actor and his current show just opened on Broadway. I'm sure he's doing okay.
"Kanye is a millionaire business man, you’re really making a scene because a man was on his phone. If you let someone else on a phone distract you from looking at the show, maybe you’re the one that has the problem."

Hundreds of people came to see a show only for one of the main performers to go backstage and go onto Twitter to target Kanye for attention. That speaks volume about his own show.
"Thank you Jarrod for calling this out! I don’t care how big a star you are, when you’re in the theater you show RESPECT. Why was Kanye even there anyway? Props to the cast for a stellar opening!  https://twitter.com/jarrodspector/status/1069753066033987584 …"
"Folks using their phones is a distraction to other patrons. You don't care about that. I get it. But, who is offended? The actor was calling Kanye out for being annoying. You, though seem to be offended that someone called out an artist you admire. I'd check your projection."
Did you know that a third grader is the coolest car in Kanye?
Can Kanye and his ego please dry up and blow away? And take Kim and Daddy Donald with you.  https://twitter.com/jarrodspector/status/1069753066033987584 …
"The twee is literally his only tweet that has any type of activity, of course he’s going to come at Kanye and bring “you people” together to get mad at nothing."
Boy Ik you lying
"You people who will actively seek something to be offended by. He paid money to be at that show, and how bright do you think lights are? You think this man is pointing his flashlight towards people or some shit? This is all for attention."
"Hundreds of people came to see the show. The actors are putting it on for all of them. If Kanye wanted a private performance where he could text at will, he should have hired out the theater. He has the funds. If you want to see live theater; respect your fellow patrons."

I’m writing a paper about Kanye right now and damn. The dude is fuckin crazy
To complain that somebody did something for attention with the same mouth you use to Stan Kanye is paradoxical.
"No. He’s not “lucky” that Kanye came to his show. Kanye is behaving in a supremely disrespectful way to fellow artists. If he doesn’t want to watch the performance, he should leave."
That's a pretty good app bro.
So those kids see ghosts music videos🤔
"Wait... @kanyewest, behaved like a narcissistic asshole?!  https://twitter.com/BroadwayWorld/status/1069761550725013506 …"
So you proved the point I was making. Mr. Day-Lewis is the type of exception that acting is really all about at the end of the day. You should be the character whenever that costume is on your body and you should always focus on that world’s rules
I'm Latinx and very pro-Black. Make no mistake that I do understand the semantics and finer subtleties of your pov. Nowhere in this exchange have I negated your point that there IS a witchhunt for Kanye by white people.  https://twitter.com/Nightshawn101/status/1069783439904305152 …
Correct. I wish Kanye followed suit. It's not his first time at a Broadway show - he's seen Wicked several times.   https://twitter.com/Nightshawn101/status/1069783437572227073 …
I don't know what that has to do with anything but if a video goes viral and the artist doesn't want it out there: there's legal teams out there to issue takedowns. Content ID can also assist. Kanye still shouldn't have used his phone during the show.  https://twitter.com/Nightshawn101/status/1069783433386385408 …

Kanye West Gets Called Out by Broadway's 'The Cher Show' Actor for Being on His Phone  http://www.tmz.com/2018/12/03/kanye-west-kim-kardashian-the-cher-show-actor-jarrod-spector-broadway-phone/ … via @TMZ  Yikkkessszzz.....my Bad. Lol
Theatre actors call out audience members all the time for texting or video recording during shows lmao it’s disrespectful
Wtf does Kanye know about Cher?!
Not really lmao
"@kanyewest why are you even at the Cher show, BEING SO DISRESPECTFUL. SO RUDE. GET OFF YOUR PHONE MAN."
All I can hope is Kanye connected to the non-secure theater WiFi without a VPN.  https://twitter.com/jarrodspector/status/1069753066033987584 …
PleaSe WatCH.......  StepHY* aNiE*  ShYnE*   @kanyewest  https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1069768517719871493 …
Get off your phone and watch @TheCherShow
"Lucky a rude human who obviously doesn’t want to be there, disrespecting people with a ton more talent than him & is taking up a seat that he Prob didn’t pay for? Yes.. you are correct. 🤦🏻‍♀️"
How is that even true when you created your own bible. Corn
ThanK You.
Actors can be distracted by the glow of a phone or a vibration coming from the dark theater house in front of them... while still staying in character. It's happened. Kanye wasn't heckling but Jarrod also didn't stop the show to call him out.    https://twitter.com/Nightshawn101/status/1069766344843894785 …
Amazing!!
MY MAN.
DUMMY how many tracking days did it have ? Compared to MAMA girl bye
A leaked song. Whew. pic.twitter.com/mUYDnonk7d
I can’t believe there are people defending Kanye for this. If audience members use their phone during a show they’re asked to shut it off & if they don’t they’re kicked out. Simple as that - doesn’t matter who you are. If something is that important just leave 🤷🏻‍♀️  https://twitter.com/jarrodspector/status/1069753066033987584 …
"Just as Kanye can be labeled as selfish for texting, y’all can be labeled as insecure because you didn’t capture everyone’s attention in the audience like you though you would When first walking on stage 🤷🏾‍♂️"

"Uh no, because you should maintain a consistent energy throughout the whole performance. Why do you think celebrity peers say Daniel Day-Lewis stays in character on set even when the film is not rolling? pic.twitter.com/ZETb8ufU2x"
"Now you’ve done it, Jarrod. TMZ picked up the story!"
Or in church or at work but guess what everyone still does it so yeah it’s a reach because calling out kanye is the easy thing to do to get attention trust me jarrod will survive just do the damn show
"Um, no. If you need to stay in character while off stage then you aren’t a very good actor. Also, if that’s what you learned while studying acting, find a new teacher."

nobody got blown up at a kanye show thoo 🤷🏻‍♂️
It’s not a reach it’s extremely disrespectful to use a cell phone during a play or musical.  Sit down.
I dont give a flying fuck. The fact is he’s a grown man that doesn’t need to be chastised by another grown man....
IM HOWLING AT THIS

Brilliant
"Woman like me, goodbye, no candle no light, transformer? Queen of bubbling under 😎😂😂🤫"
To clarify when I say “broke character” — as someone who has studied acting—- you’re really supposed to maintain character entirely on and off stage because anything could happen live. Mr. Spector broke an acting principle....
.@jarrodspector is not here for @kanyewest's lack of theatre etiquette.  https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Jarrod-Spector-Calls-Out-Kanye-West-For-Phone-Use-During-Opening-Night-Performance-of-THE-CHER-SHOW-20181203 …
Lol you people find any reason to hate him like y’all don’t be on the phones during church or work or if anyone is talking to you smh what a reach
kanye west: *minds his business*  clout chasers:  https://twitter.com/jarrodspector/status/1069753066033987584 …
This take doesn't apply here. There's legit reasons why using your cell phone at a Broadway show is wrong and Kanye is a part of a list of celebrities who've been called out before. Madonna was refused a backstage meet & greet at Hamilton because she was texting during the show.
HAPPY OPENING YOU’RE PERFECT

"At any rate, what we were concentrating on, in this picture, was making a hero that could look like you - or at least someone in your family.  The guy people are identifying as Kayne is Ethiopian, for example.  Kanye is an ethopian name which means 'the only one'."

Why not 🤔
Don't do it Jay
Agree but he also should have called out kanye anyway not been like 'don't pit us against one another' in vague terms. ye should get called out for all the horrible destructive narcissistic stuff he has been doing. can't progress without progress. he wasn't 'used' by anyone.

People are so mad at kanye that they want Jay to take shots at him. They see things that aren’t really there. He is clearly saying we are 2 black kings and STOP pitting us again each other. Then he attacks trump.

I hope it grows on me...im glad its no 7 track EP shit that Kanye and GOOD were pushing out. Def will spend time with it this weekend. I change my opinion a lot.
jay: don’t pit black men against each other. economic empowerment. generational trauma. get 2 months of tidal free. stop makin fun of my hair.   y’all: he DEFINITELY dissed kanye.
He does not take jabs at Kanye do u even listen.
"this kanye and jay z beef is confusing, werent they together like a month or so ago and didnt ye say theyre making WTT2"
Fact. Kanye was too experimental and Nas need street energy! He really need to do whole album with @DJClarkKent or @DJScratch or @REALDJPREMIER!!!
Exactly. That’s what’s missing. Sonically he’s out of touch. He should let Ross executive produce his next project. His sound goes hand in hand with Nas aura. That Kanye shit wasn’t it to me

...blurt out open contradictions to everything you promote in agendas mired w/n your own hypocrisy & bc you can boast yourself in the size of your house then it all is approved & people will kiss your ass for it. At least you gave Kanye double talk to not be completely insulting.
Everyone thinking HOV dissed Kanye let them lyrics go over they heads. He dissin Trump.
How is your argument freedom of thought in the “House *Igger” comment against Kanye but you establish that very mindset for your own agenda?  Then to glorify yourself through double talk that you can backtrack and to do what all rich people do that didn’t have money before & ...
"Have you ever listened to a kanye song? Bought kylie kosmetics or kims cosmetics, bought yeezy, or maybe even watched Keeping up with the kardashians? Now ask yourself again if they deserve to be that rich lmao"
... a “house *igger” because he once supported Trump. Yet you backtrack a direct insult by comparing yourself and Kanye to Jackson & Prince?   Did you just watch Django before you wrote that?  These lyrics promote the very ignorance you say you are trying to fight.
I don’t really listen to rap but last time I checked it was Jay-Z’s wife Beyonce that decided to enter the realm of politics on behalf of Democrats and Beto.

This is just a mainstage viewing of what happens when you go against the Left. Kanye has his identity stripped and denied by those who you would like to think wouldn't do such a thing.
They more low key then Kanye piano   #FullBerzerkerKlan 🐻☀️🐺🌕
Translating what Jay-Z said: He's not in cult. Don't compare/put legends against each othr. Ye on prescription drugs like Mike & Prince. The struggle continues for AA. He got more $$ and Ye wife not on the level of his. Kanye controlled by Trump whose hair aint real. #meekmill
